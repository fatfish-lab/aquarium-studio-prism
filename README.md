Now, we need to configure the categories of Prism to match the corresponding Aquarium's tasks :

    1. During Aquarium to Prism sync, if a task doesn't exist, the categorie will be ignored
    1. Configuration example. If you are using our Prism demo project available in Aquarium studio, you can copy the following pipeline_steps : 
        ```yml
        - pipeline_steps: !!omap
            - 3d:

## Documentation

A dedicated documentation is in writing progress. In the meantime, fill free to [contact us](https://fatfi.sh/contact-us/) if you have any questions or issues.

## Security disclaimer
To connect and exchange data between Prism and Aquarium Studio, you need to add your Aquarium's credentials.

During this process, you will be asked to provide your email and password. Those data will not be stored in the Prism's user settings file. Instead we only store the user authentication token.

This token is stored in **plain text** in the `Prism.yml` file of the user. We are currently implementing a solution to encrypt this token.
